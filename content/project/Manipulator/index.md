TigerArm, a manipulator mainly developed by me, is also based on MoveIt!. In the perception part, RealSense D435i depth camera was
used, PCL point cloud library and deep learning algorithm Yolov3 were used too. For details, please
see my Github repository(https://github.com/cypypccpy/21_tigerarm_ros). Originally, this mechanical arm was developed to serve the RoboMaster competition. **Click Video to see the Demo.**
