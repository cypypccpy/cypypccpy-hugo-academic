abstract: Owing to hand dexterity and bimanual coordination, bimanual dexterous manipulation remains a challenging problem for traditional robotic control methods. To reduce the reliance on complex modeling and manual parameter-tuning, reinforcement learning (RL) provides a model-agnostic approach for in-hand manipulation. Despite the remarkable success in the single-hand setting, there has not been enough evidence to illustrate the efficient performance in dual-hand manipulation. Therefore, in this paper, we proposed a bimanual dexterous manipulation benchmark, Bi-DexHands, with diverse scenarios for single-agent and multi-agent reinforcement learning algorithms. Thanks to GPU accelerating simulations on the Isaac Gym, experiments demonstrate that SOTA continuous model-free RL/Multi-Agent RL methods can achieve a comprehensive performance on our proposed tasks. Furthermore, Introducing a large number of tasks and target objects enables two hands to learn general skills according to metal or multi-task reinforcement learning algorithms. We open-sourced this benchmark and implemented a series of reinforcement learning algorithms at https://github.com/xxx.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We propose Simulation Twin (SimTwin) &#58 a deep reinforcement learning framework that can help directly transfer the model from simulation to reality without any real-world training.
